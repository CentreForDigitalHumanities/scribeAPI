## Tips & Tricks

### Search
* **Use quotation marks to search for full phrases.**
* **Capitalization does not matter in search.**
* **Consider abbreviations.**  
We asked users to transcribe exactly what they saw written on the records. For this reason, abbreviations may have been used. For example, the word Brooklyn may appear as “BKLYN” in one record and “Brooklyn” in another.

### Reading a Record  
The data in these records have been communally created through the Emigrant City participatory project. See the Intro Page for more information on the process of publicly and collaboratively creating this resource. The collaborative nature of this resource is demonstrated in the records fields. Each record has four sections: the record itself, Best Data, All Data, and Source Metadata.

* **High res versions of record**  
Emigrant City is a project and resource to browse historic mortgage records from the Emigrant Savings Bank. You may view and/or download high resolution images of these records on our Digital Collections site. If you would like to view the high resolution version of a record, navigate to the Source Metadata tab and click on the Page Uri Link.

* **Best Data versus All Data**  
A record's best data consolidates and lightly cleans all the fields for that record. During the transcription process, the same field may have been marked multiple times and made it all the way through the Scribe work-flow resulting in duplications of that field. Best data consolidates these duplications. There is also minimal formatting cleanup so, for instance, Amount Loaned appears as a dollar amount rather than a number.

* **What is the Source Metadata?**  
The content on this page is the technical metadata associated with a record.


* **What is the confidence field?**  
The metadata for these records was created through contributions from many users. A result of this process is that we can gauge how confident we are for each field. Fields with an 100% confidence ratings are fields for which every transcription was the same. Lower confidence ratings mean that there was disagreement on how best to transcribe a field.

* **What is a field's status?**  
The status of each field is displayed. This corresponds with where the field's transcription is in the work-flow of the project.

* **What are distinct transcriptions?**  
As you may notice, fields display the number of distinct transcriptions they have received during the project's run. A distinct transcription of 1 means everyone transcribed the same thing for that field.

* **Why are there field repetitions in this record? Why is a field missing from this record?**
  You may notice that for some records, fields appear multiple times. Sometimes multiple different fields are associated with one record. For example, [Record 3758](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/data/exports/56b109ac7061755afbfdbb00?keyword="Eunice R. Waterbury"&field=undefined) has two mortgagors listed: "Eunice R. Waterbury" and "Eloise B. Crothers."

* **Which fields appear?**
This project intended to create a index to enable further discovery. With this project, the goal is to create an index of the bond and mortgage records to enable further discovery and use. We’ve worked with experts on the material to scope the data collected to fields which appear with greater regularity across documents: Record Date, Record Number, Mortgager Name, Street Address, Amount Loaned, Valuation, and Dimension & Description. Collecting and verifying these fields from the records creates resource that opens up the search of these materials. However, the data being gathered is not an exhaustive. Rather than creating a complete transcription of each record, the transcribed fields create an index to give some toeholds for future reference and querying of these rich materials which previously were largely invisible and difficult to search.

<!-- * **What geographic areas are covered?** -->
<!-- Will including this confuse? In this mortgage, the mortgage date appears three times. The project is structured to allow for multiple fields on one page. Multiple users marked the same field which resulted in the same date, “Mar. 23/03,” being transcribed several times.-->
