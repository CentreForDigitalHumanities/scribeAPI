## Emigrant Savings Bank

Emigrant Savings Bank is the oldest savings bank in New York City and the ninth-largest privately owned bank in the country. The bank was founded in 1850 by 18 members of the Irish Emigrant Society with the goal of serving the needs of the immigrant community in New York. The headquarters used to be at the [Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank building on Chambers Street](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e2-eef8-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). Emigrant Savings collected extensive records of the arriving Irish immigrants to America, which were later donated to the New York Public Library and serve as valuable genealogical resources. The entire collection has been microfilmed and the detailed [finding aid](http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/documents/documentation/collection_1837_mss925-extra.pdf) outlines the full scope of the [Emigrant Savings Bank records](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/925). While the collection belongs to the Manuscripts and Archives Division, users primarily encounter it through the Irma and Paul Milstein Division of United States History, Local History and Genealogy division of the Library. (Coincidentally, the Milstein family owns Emigrant Savings Bank today).

## This Project

The collection includes mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata. While the Bank's records have been digitized and poured over by generations of genealogists, the real estate materials appear to be largely unknown and underutilized.

From these materials, we can extract structured, building-level records for about 6,400 mortgages. Building a keyword searchable and structured index of names and mortgage details should be of tremendous use to genealogists, provides a new source of material for historians, and creates useful location data for the Library's [NYC Space/Time directory](http://spacetime.nypl.org/).

## How does it work?

We're not trying to comprehensively transcribe every bit of text in these records. Like all Scribe projects, this endeavor focuses on specific fields within each record. The selected fields are key to telling the stories within this 19th century paperwork. The fields we're focusing on are the Record date, Record number, Mortgager Name, Street address, Amount loaned, Valuation, Dimensions, and Building description. <!--update if we add more fields--> We have broken into three tasks, the work of capturing these fields. Volunteers (you!) can contribute in any of these tasks, or all of them. There's no sign up, just try them all out!

In the [Mark](/#/mark) phase, volunteers identify which fields appear on the page. During the [Transcribe](/#/transcribe) portion, these fields are displayed for transcription. Each field is transcribed by three different volunteers. IF these transcriptions are the same, we assume they are correct and stop gathering transcriptions for this field. If the transcriptions differ, they move on to the [Verify](/#/verify) task. In this task, volunteers are asked to arbitrate between transcriptions and chose the most accurate, or add their own!

## Scribe

[Scribe](http://scribe.nypl.org/) is a generalized framework for building community transcription and annotation projects. Scribe has a special interest in alleviating some of the strain of launching "crowd-source" projects around digital humanities materials fully or partially resistant to existing approaches like OCR and flat text transcription. (We say partially resistant because we foresee possibilities of building a Scribe project in tandem with OCRed text.)
