Scribe is a generalized framework for building community transcription and annotation projects. Scribe has a special interest in alleviating some of the strain of launching "crowd-source" projects around digital humanities materials fully or partially resistant to existing approaches like OCR and flat text transcription. [[Slides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/scribe.nypl.org/slides/index.html)] We say partially resistent because we forsee the possibility of building a Scribe project which incorporates OCR. Using contributers's annotations in the Mark task, one could seed the transcription fields for correction and verification. By using the Scribe framework in tandem with OCR, it's possible to augment OCR text with the tabular data inherent in the sort of structured materials Scribe helps unlock.

## Emigrant Savings Bank

Emigrant Savings Bank is the oldest savings bank in New York City and the ninth-largest privately owned bank in the country. The bank was founded in 1850 by 18 members of the Irish Emigrant Society with the goal of serving the needs of the immigrant community in New York. The headquarters used to be at the [Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank building on Chambers Street](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e2-eef8-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). Emigrant Savings collected extensive records of the arriving Irish immigrants to America, which were later donated to the New York Public Library and serve as valuable genealogical resources. The entire collection has been microfilmed and the collection's detailed [finding aid](http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/documents/documentation/collection_1837_mss925-extra.pdf) outlines the full scope of the [Emigrant Savings Bank records](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/925) and the range of infomation to be found. The collection belongs to Manuscripts and Archives, but the primary users are the Milstein Collection (coincidentally, the Milstein family owns Emigrant Savings Bank today).

## This Project
The collection includes mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata.

As the finding aid describes these real estate materials:
> The Bond and Mortgage Books and Bond and Mortgage Ledgers record real estate transactions and have their own numbers which can be found in the Bond and Mortgage Name Index. The entries in the Bond and Mortgage Books include the date of approval, name of mortgagor, house number, size of the ground, description of the building, the amount of the loan, the name of the attorney, and in most cases a drawing of the location on a block map. There are also five Real Estate Loans Ledgers pertaining to the years 1902 to 1923. Information to be found in the Real Estate Loans Ledgers include the applicantâ€™s name, the amount of money requested (at 5% interest) location of ground and building, material the building is to be made of, and the number of floors.

There are about 6,400 mortgages in the 10 reels that make up the Bond and Mortgage holdings, and another set relate to the ledgers. Focusing in on these records, we can extract, as structured content, the building-level mortgage records from the Emigrant Savings Bank creates a dataset of financial information about the landholding and financial patterns of new NYC immigrants in the second half of the 19th century and augments our building-level understanding of places in NYC. Building a keyword searchable, and structured index of names and mortgage details should have a tremendous appeal to genealogists for transcription, provide a new source of material for historians, and provide NYPL with useful location data for the [NYC Space/Time directory](http://spacetime.nypl.org/).

## How does it work?
