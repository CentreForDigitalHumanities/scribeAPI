Scribe is a generalized framework for building community transcription and annotation projects. Scribe has a special interest in alleviating some of the strain of launching "crowd-source" projects around digital humanities materials fully or partially resistant to existing approaches like OCR and flat text transcription. [[Slides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/scribe.nypl.org/slides/index.html)] We say partially resistent because we forsee the possibility of building a Scribe project which incorporates OCR. Using contributers's annotations in the Mark task, one could seed the transcription fields for correction and verification. By using the Scribe framework in tandem with OCR, it's possible to augment OCR text with the tabular data inherent in the sort of structured materials Scribe helps unlock.

## Emigrant Savings Bank

Emigrant Savings Bank is the oldest savings bank in New York City and the ninth-largest privately owned bank in the country. The bank was founded in 1850 by 18 members of the Irish Emigrant Society with the goal of serving the needs of the immigrant community in New York. The headquarters used to be at the [Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank building on Chambers Street](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e2-eef8-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99). Emigrant Savings collected extensive records of the arriving Irish immigrants to America, which were later donated to the New York Public Library and serve as valuable genealogical resources. The entire collection has been microfilmed and the collection's detailed [finding aid](http://archives.nypl.org/uploads/documents/documentation/collection_1837_mss925-extra.pdf) outlines the full scope of the [Emigrant Savings Bank records](http://archives.nypl.org/mss/925) and the range of infomation to be found. The collection belongs to Manuscripts and Archives, but the primary users are the Milstein Collection (coincidentally, the Milstein family owns Emigrant Savings Bank today).

## This Project
The collection includes mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata.

While Bank's records have been digitized and poured over by generations of genealogists, including through Ancestry.com, their real estate materials appear to be largely unknown and underutilized.

These materials include their mortgage and bond records: loans taken out (we suspect mostly by relatively new immigrants) to buy properties and to mortgage existing real estate; an essential step in moving up in New York's economic strata.

We suspect building a keyword searchable, and structured index of names like this will have a tremendous appeal to genealogists for transcription, provide a new source of material for historians, and provide NYPL with useful location data for the NYC Space/â€ ime directory.
