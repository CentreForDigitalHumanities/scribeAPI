# Street Address

The street address is often found at the top of the list of hand-entered data in the bottom half of the records. This field can appear as "No. of Street or Avenue", "House Number", "Premises", and "Location". Enter the building address as appears e.g. "39 Mott St", "S. W. corner of 7th Avenue & 25th St. No 226 7th Avenue", "Mulberry, Mott and Prince St."
