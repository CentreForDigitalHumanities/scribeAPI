# Valuation  

Some records include valuations comprised of an assessment date and dollar values. Valuations can be of the land, the building, and the total, or a combination of the three. Valuations can sometimes be difficult to find. These are hand-written and are typically found at or near the bottom of the record. If there are multiple valuations, draw one box around all of them. Be sure to include in the box both the dates and dollar amounts of the valuations.  

Example: "1879 November Valuation of premises $1200"
