# Existing Marks

You may see existing rectangles on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the field and there's no need to mark an area twice. If you see any on the page, disregard bad marks (ie marks around the wrong field or around an empty part of the page.) These bad marks will be weeded out in the transcribe task.

You can manipulate the digitized pages with tools on the left hand side of the screen. Here you'll find the zoom tool and a mark toggle. The mark toggle allows you to hide other people's marks from the page.

The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in the next task phase.
