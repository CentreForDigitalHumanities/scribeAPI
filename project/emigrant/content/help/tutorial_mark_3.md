# Fields

Use the menu on the right to select a field (e.g. "Record Date"). Then, use your mouse to draw a box on the image around each place that the field appears.  

As an aid, the fields are color coded. All the boxes for that field will appear in the same color.  

For additional, field specific guidance select the help buttons next to each field label. Each field is annotated with the number of marks made already.
