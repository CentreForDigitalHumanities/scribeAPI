# Task
Your task is to identify fields in a series of bank records. You'll be working with digitized pages from the Bank's record books. Typically, each page has **two records**. Sometimes, one or both of the records are obscured by another image or an insert on the page.  
If there's an issue preventing you from reading the records or if there is no information recorded on the page, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane.
