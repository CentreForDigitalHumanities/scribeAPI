# Task
Your task is to identify fields in a series of bank records. You'll be working with digitized pages from the Bank's record books. Sometimes the record, or a portion of it, is obscured by an image or note pasted on the page.

If a the entire record is obscured or if there is no information recorded on the page, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane.
