# Dimensions and Description
<p>Some records include the ground dimensions and/or a description of the building. These are often found below the street address in the hand-entered data in the bottom half of the records. Otherwise, they may be written in the drawing of the building footprint in the top half of the records. Include both the dimensions and the description when you draw a box.</p>
