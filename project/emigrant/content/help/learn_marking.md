To the right of the screen, you'll see some field labels. Select a field and draw a rectangle around each field that appears on the page.

You may see existing rectangles on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the field and there's no need to mark an area twice. For additional, field specific guidance select the help buttons next to each field label.

The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in the next task phase.
