Join us in transcribing 19th century real estate records from the Emigrant Savings Bank. These unique documents reveal the lives and dreams of Irish and German immigrants who helped create modern New York. Help unlock a vital piece of history!

## How You Can Help

We've broken up the work into three free-standing tasks.

 * <a class="major-button" href="/#/mark">Mark</a> Locate key information on the documents (e.g. dates, mortgager name). No typing, just drawing boxes.
 * <a class="major-button" href="/#/transcribe">Transcribe</a> Type out the fields marked by fellow volunteers. Modest deciphering of old handwriting required!
 * <a class="major-button" href="/#/verify">Verify</a> Sometimes transcribers disagree. Help arbitrate and ensure that the highest quality data is produced.

You may find you prefer one task over another, so try them all! All tasks are essential steps in the greater effort to unlock the history of land ownership in 19th century NYC!
