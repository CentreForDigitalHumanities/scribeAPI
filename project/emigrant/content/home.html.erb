Emigrant Savings Bank is the oldest savings bank in New York City and the ninth-largest privately owned bank in the country. The bank was founded in 1850 by 18 members of the Irish Emigrant Society with the goal of serving the needs of the immigrant community in New York.

By extracting structured, building-level mortgage records from the Emigrant Savings Bank, we're creating a dataset of financial information about the landholding and financial patterns of new NYC immigrants in the second half of the 19th century.
