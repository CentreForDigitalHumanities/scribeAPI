## Data exports

With help from volunteers like yourself, we are extracting structured, building-level information from about 6,400 mortgages which would have otherwise remained invisible to the public. Building a keyword- searchable and structured index of names and mortgage details will of tremendous use to genealogists, historians, and hobbyists alike.

_Emigrant City_ was built to be open from the beginning. [The code](http://scribeproject.github.io/) that runs this website is open source. And all data generated through _Emigrant City_ will be made publicly available.

After enough transcriptions are made, our team will determine the best way to get the data to you in an easy and accessible way.  More on this coming soon!
