### Tips & Tricks
* **Use quotation marks to search for full phrases.**
* **Capitalization doesn’t matter in search.**
* **Why are there field repetitions in this record? Why is a field missing from this record?**
  You may notice that for some records, fields appear multiple times. Sometimes multiple different fields are associated with one record. For example, [Record 3758](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/data/exports/56b109ac7061755afbfdbb00?keyword="Eunice R. Waterbury"&field=undefined) has two mortgagors listed: "Eunice R. Waterbury" and "Eloise B. Crothers."

* **What fields appear?**
This project intended to create a index to enable further discovery. With this project, the goal is to create an index of the bond and mortgage records to enable further discovery and use. We’ve worked with experts on the material to scope the data collected to fields which appear with greater regularity across documents: Record Date, Record Number, Mortgager Name, Street Address, Amount Loaned, Valuation, and Dimension & Description. Collecting and verifying these fields from the records creates resource that opens up the search of these materials. However, the data being gathered is not an exhaustive. Rather than creating a complete transcription of each record, the transcribed fields create an index to give some toeholds for future reference and querying of these rich materials which previously were largely invisible and difficult to search.

* **Consider abbreviations.**
We asked users to transcribe exactly what they saw written on the records. For this reason, abbreviations may have been used. For example, the word Brooklyn may appear as “BKLYN” in one record and “Brooklyn” in another.

* **What is the confidence field?**
The metadata for these records was created through contributions from many users. A result of this process is that we can guage how confident we are for each field.

<!-- * **What geographic areas are covered?** -->
<!-- Will including this confuse? In this mortgage, the mortgage date appears three times. The project is structured to allow for multiple fields on one page. Multiple users marked the same field which resulted in the same date, “Mar. 23/03,” being transcribed several times.-->
