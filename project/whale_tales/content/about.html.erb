##Welcome to Old Weather: Whaling!

Old Weather: Whaling is the sister project of the Zooniverse’s successful and ongoing Old Weather, run by the same team. These projects allow online volunteers to assist in exploring, marking, and transcribing ship’s logs, largely from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like the original Old Weather, OW:W is about extracting historic weather measurements (and other data) from these logs. However, OW:W offers particular focus on observations of sea ice, which many whaling ships sailed through and documented while navigating Arctic waters.

By participating in Old Weather: Whaling, you’ll be helping to advance research in multiple fields. Data about sea ice and other weather events are useful  to climate scientists, while historians value knowing the course of a voyage and the events that transpired on board. You might even discover something that takes everyone by surprise. We hope you’ll join us on this exciting dive into maritime history!

##Why we’re studying old whaling logs and sea ice

As whale populations decreased along shorelines and in warmer waters in the 1800’s, whalers were increasingly forced to brave dangerous and frigid Arctic seas, filled with ice floes and icebergs, to find their prey. Because of this, their logbooks contain rare, valuable, and accurate climate observations from locations where few others dared venture. These historical observations can assist tremendously with filling in the gaps in the climate models that help us predict future weather.

##Why we need you, and what we do with your work

The task of digitizing logbooks is nearly impossible for computers, due to diverse and idiosyncratic handwriting that only human beings can read well. For an individual researcher, or a small team, this means that digitizing thousands of logbooks presents an extremely daunting challenge! However, by harnessing the efforts of volunteers online, not only can we transcribe these logs much more quickly, but we can do it more accurately as well. Since several people look at each log, errors are filtered out and correct transcriptions are almost always achieved.

The data you extract from the logbooks will be used by scientists, geographers, historians, and the public around the world. Anyone with an interest in the data will be able to access it and use it. In this form, it can also be used by computers to make models. For instance, by taking the observations and reconstructing patterns of sea-ice levels, climate scientists can gain the understanding necessary to make better climate projections and predictions.
