### Explore the documented adventures of whaling ships in the Arctic. Discover in their writings new clues about climatology and history.


Whalers have sought their quarry in perilous Arctic waters for centuries. Their ships’ logbooks contain detailed observations of the often difficult weather and sea-ice conditions they faced, as well as first-hand accounts of all kinds of events. Climate scientists and historians alike have much to learn from these logs—but first they need your help to mark and transcribe them.
