In this project, you’ll be working alongside other volunteers to digitize logbooks from 19th- and early 20th-century whaling ships. By extracting information about sea-ice levels, weather, events onboard, and more, you’ll be contributing to both climate science and historical research. This brief tutorial will help teach you how to get started.
