In “Mark,” you will follow the instructions to the right of each page to identify important elements in each page. For some questions, you will need to draw rectangles on the page. You will see marks submitted by other volunteers as well, although you can hide these for visibility. __You do not need to re-mark things that have already been marked!__ You can also delete others’ marks; this votes for those marks being incorrect.
