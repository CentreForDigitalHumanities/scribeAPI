Mark the place name of the recipient, the destination of the letter. This information is usually absent, but sometimes it is located above the first line of the letter, to the right (e.g. "London", or "Romam").

If you cannot or are unsure if the word(s) you see refer to a place, look it up here: http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/contents.html.
