# Characters

- Transcribe large capitals (initials) in the beginning of letters, even if they partly fall outside of the marking box.
- Treat <span style="font-variant:small-caps">small caps</span> as normal caps.
- Note the **s** is often printed as **ſ**. If this s is italiced, it looks as **ʃ**. So this **s** looks like a (long) **f** but it is in fact an **s**.
- A double **ss** is sometimes printed as **ʃS** or **ß** and looks like the German **ß**. Please transcribe this as **ss**. So **eßet** = **esset**.
- Transcribe **Æ**, **æ**, **Œ** and **œ** as **Ae**, **ae**, **Oe** and **oe** respectively.
- Ignore accents such as **é**, **â** and **ù** and transcribe as **e**, **a** and **u**.
- A dash above a vowel is not an accent, but usually indicates that the vowel should be followed by an **m** or **n**. **Nū** means **Num**, **nō** means **non**, **enī** means **enim**, **tēpore** means **tempore**, **annū** means **annum**, and **ī** means **in**.
- The sign **CIƆ** or **cIɔ** or **Iɔ** in Roman numbers stands for **M** and the sign **IƆ** stands for **D**. So please transcribe **CIƆ IƆ** as **M D**.
