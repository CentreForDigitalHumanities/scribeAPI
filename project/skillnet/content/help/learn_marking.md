# Hi!

Your task is to draw a box around metadata in letters. You'll be working with digitized letters from printed correspondence collections. Typically, a letter consists of one or multiple pages in the collection. If there's an issue preventing you from reading the page or if there is no relevant information on the page, select the "Nothing to mark" button in the right hand pane.

Use the menu on the right to select a metadata-category (e.g. "Sender"). Then, use your mouse to draw a box on the page around the words containing these metadata. Every type of metadata category has its own colour. Select the help buttons next to each metadata-category if you want to know more.

You may see existing rectangles on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the field and there's no need to mark it twice.

You can adjust the digitized pages with tools on the left hand side of the screen. Here you'll find the zoom tool and a mark toggle.

The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in step 2.
