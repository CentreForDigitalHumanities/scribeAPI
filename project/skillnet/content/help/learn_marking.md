# Hi!

Your task is to identify fields in a series of letters. You'll be working with digitized letters from correspondence collections. Typically, a letter consists of multiple pages in the collection. If there's an issue preventing you from reading the page or if there is no information recorded on the page, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane.

Use the menu on the right to select a field (e.g. "Sender"). Then, use your mouse to draw a box on the image around the place where that is written. As an aid, the fields are color coded. All the boxes for that field will appear in the same color. For additional, field specific guidance select the help buttons next to each field label.

You may see existing rectangles on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the field and there's no need to mark an area twice.

You can manipulate the digitized pages with tools on the left hand side of the screen. Here you'll find the zoom tool and a mark toggle. 

The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in the next task phase.
