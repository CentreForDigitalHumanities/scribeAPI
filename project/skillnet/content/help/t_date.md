First, type the date as given. If you cannot find the date, look for Roman numerals, the words Anno (ao, Ao) , Anno Domini (ad, AD), Anno Domini Salutis (Salvationis, Sal.), a.d. (ante diem), Cal. (Kal., Kalendas), Non. (Nonas), or Id. (Idus). If you still cannot detect the date (it might not be recorded in the letter), leave the field empty and press "Next Entry".

Once you have transcribed the date, you have the option to select the type of date that is recorded in the letter. If you are unsure about the type or if the type of date in the letter is not in the list, please select the default option "Other/Unknown" and move on. Otherwise, select "Plain date" (for example 12 October 1679), "Holiday" (for example two days before Easter 1501), or "Roman date" (for example a.d. XVI Kal. Mart. MDCLXII).

The program will now automatically copy your data into different categories. Please have a look if they are correctly assigned. For a plain date: day, month, year. For a holiday: holiday, year, and possible offset days before or after the holiday. For a Roman date: actual day, principal day, months, and year. If one of the entries is not recorded in the letter or not listed as an option, please leave the field blank or select the default option "Other/Unknown".

The last thing you have to select is whether the Julian or Gregorian calendar was used in the letter. If you do not know, please select the default option "Unknown".
