Transcribe the place name of the recipient, or destination of the letter, as given. This is usually found above the letter as information provided by the editor of the book, although this information is often lacking. Note that in Latin letters place names are Latinized, which are not always easily recognisable. If you are unsure if the word(s) you see refer(s) to a place, look it up here: http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/contents.html.
