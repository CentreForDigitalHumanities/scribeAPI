# Transcribe

Transcribe the text exactly as you see it. For additional help and sample transcriptions, each transcription prompt has an "Need some help" button providing field specific context.

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going.

If the field is indecipherable, mark it as _Illegible_ and move on to the next entry. If there is no information to transcribe, select _Bad region_ and move on to the next entry.
