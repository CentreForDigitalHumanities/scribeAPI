Mark the recipient of a letter (the person who receives it), usually found at the top of a letter.
In Latin, names ending with -s usually refer to the author (letter writer) (for example ‘Carolus’) and an ending in -m or -o  usually refers to the recipient (for example, ‘Carolo’). 
If a series of letters is addressed to the same person, you will sometimes find the expression ‘ad eundem’ (‘to the same’) above the letter, or ‘idem ad eundum’ (‘the same person to the same’). Then draw a box around ‘ad eundum’.
