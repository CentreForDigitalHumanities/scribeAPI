# Dealing with boxes already on the page
You may see existing boxes on the page. If this is the case, someone has already marked the fields. We have chosen for all the pages to be shown twice, to insure the quality of the data that is transcribed. There is no need to mark them twice. Sometimes, you might see that others have left bad marks (marks around the wrong field or around an empty part of the page). Ignore any bad marks you see. They will be weeded out in the Transcribe task. Instead, mark the correct fields or pick up where they left off.

On the left side of your screen, there is a tool box to zoom in and out or move to other pages. On the left side of your screen, you find a mark button. The mark button allows you to hide other people's marks from the page. The marks created in this task identify the fields to be transcribed in the next task phase.
