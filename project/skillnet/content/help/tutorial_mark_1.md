# Task
Your task is to identify specific pieces of information in a series of digitized letters.

If the entire page is obscured, illegible or blank, select the "Bad Page" button in the right hand pane and hit the next button to move to the next page. When there is nothing (left) on the page to mark, you can select "DONE".
