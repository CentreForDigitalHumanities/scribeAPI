First of all, transcribe the name of the recipient of a letter as given. The box may contain words that are not part of the name. Please transcribe the name of the recipient exactly as given in the letter. Note that in the heading, especially in Latin letters, the names of the recipient and of the sender can both be found next to each other. This usually takes the following form: "Erasmus Roterodamus Guilhelmo Montioio s[alutat]" ('Erasmus of Rotterdam greets William Mountjoy'). In Latin, names ending with -s usually refer to the author (letter writer) (for example "Erasmus") and an ending in -m or -o  usually refers to the recipient (for example, "Erasmo" or "ad Erasmum"). If a series of letters is addressed to the same person, you will sometimes find the expression "ad eundem" ('to the same [recipient]') above the letter, or "idem ad eundum" ('the same [sender] to the same [recipient]').

Second, if you feel confident enough about the identity of the recipient, you can use the second box to search for his or her standardized name from a drop-down menu and then select it.
