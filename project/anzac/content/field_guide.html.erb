  Personnel files include a variety of types of documents. The first step in creating a rich transcription of the files is identifying what type of document a piece of information comes from. In the future, identifying what types of documents are present in any given file will allow us to develop follow-up studies of particular groups.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The order of documents within a personnel file is not consistent, reflecting the creation of these files across an individual’s enlistment, wartime service, and return to New Zealand. After the war, the files continued to be used by the New Zealand Defence Force in the administration of returned soldiers' benefits and the award of medals among other uses. The material was transferred to Archives New Zealand in 2006, which scanned the material in a project that spanned several years. Because of the varied composition of the files and the long working life of the documents before being archived, it is unsurprising that we encounter documents in different orders.

    <h3>History Sheet</h3>
    <div>
      <div id="att_ex" >
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/anzac-project/R7821550/FL18717394" alt="history sheet"> <br>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/anzac-project/R10927559/FL9809225" alt="statement of services">
      </div>
      <p>The History sheet, which often appears early in the file records, identifies information about the individual, their occupation, and the address of their next of kin, followed by a structured record of events that happened to individuals from enlistment through demobilization. The categories of events recorded on the History sheet are service locations and dates, wounds, sickness, killed in action, death from wounds or sickness, whether a person was formally missing in action, prisoner, injuries in service, and discharge. The first page of the History sheet is identifiable from being headed with that title, and for some periods of the war appears with the annotation “E.F. Form No. 3A” in the top right corner.</p>
      <p>The second page of the History sheets is headed Statement of Services and records in more detail the career path of the soldier, what ranks they attained, and which units they served in. The information on the History sheet will be used by researchers to summarize men's wartime experience in order to study what influenced men's health and life expectancy after the war.</p>
      <p>The bottom half of the Statement of Services sheet records instances of misconduct in a section headed Conduct. In the present project we are asking citizen scientists to indicate whether any information appears in this section. We are not currently transcribing the information about misconduct, but by identifying which files have conduct information we will be able to return to these men's files more easily in the future.</p>
      <p>Both the History Sheet and the Statement of Services are sometimes partially obscured with pesky Sticky Notes. We ask that you indicate when a page is covered by a Sticky Note. The digitization team at Archives New Zealand have scanned pages with Sticky Notes multiple times, so that information above the Sticky Note and information hiding under it can be seen. Thus, there can be multiple images of the same page. You may have to move Back or Next to find marks and transcribe when a Sticky Note covers information on the page.</p>

    <h3>Attestation</h3>
    <div>
      <div id="att_ex" >
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/anzac-project/R7821550/FL18717444" alt="attestion p1"> <br>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/anzac-project/R7821550/FL18717443" alt="attestion p2">
      </div>
      <p>The attestation is both a record of the individual's characteristics when they entered military service for World War I and a legal document that attested to the individual's willingness to serve in the military. The attestation has two pages, the first recording social and economic information along with the attestation, and the second containing a structured description of the individual's health.</p>
      <p>The attestation form changed frequently over the course of the war, with the research team having identified more than 20 distinct combinations of questions. The form can be identified through being labeled as an “Attestation” in the header.</p>
      <p>The first page of the attestation records identifying information (name, address, next of kin), education and occupation, and a range of questions on previous military service. The footer of the document records the individual’s signing of an oath in front of an attesting officer.</p>
      <p>The second page of the attestation records the results of a medical examination; the heading of this document changed during the war. The document can be consistently identified from its combination of questions. Towards the top of the page are a basic description of the person: height, weight, chest dimensions, colour of hair and eye, and any distinctive physical characteristics. There are then a series of questions about health, both those put to the recruit and some that rely on the doctor’s observation. These are typically answered yes or no. Finally the individual is classified with a fitness grade ranging from A to D.</p>

    <h3>South African War Attestation</h3>
    <div>
      <img src="assets/anzac/sa_att_ex.jpeg" alt="death notification">
      <p>The overall set of records includes not only the records of men who served in World War I, but also those from men who served only in New Zealand forces in the South African War. The attestation forms from the South African War record are a single page and include less information than a World War I attestation form.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Death Notifications</h3>
    <div>
      <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/anzac-project/R10920991/FL22335668" alt="death notification">
      <p>Many files include a death notification for individuals who died after the war. These documents are typically headed with an indication they were sent from the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages or the Department of Internal Affairs. Many of these documents were included in the files between the 1950s and 1980s. The only information being captured from these documents are the first and last names, service number, and the place and date of death.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Other Forms</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The millions of pages of records for 140,000 files also include many other types of documents, including pension or medal notifications, records of hospital treatment, proceedings of medical boards to determine a soldiers' fitness for return to combat or to return home, letters, and telegrams. We are not transcribing information off these pages in the current project. We are giving citizen scientists the opportunity to write a short description of what these other pages are in a free text field. A brief description of the other pages you see will help us organize the files for research by you, the Measuring the ANZACs team, and other researchers in the future. We hope that the short descriptions will let researchers narrow in on particular groups, such as men who received pensions, or men who returned to the front after recovering from wounds.</p>
